## Basic Statistics
- High-quality single-cell data typically exhibit minimal instances of low-quality sequences and frequently have consistent sequence lengths. 
- The GC content should closely align with the overall GC composition of the genome or transcriptome specific to the species being sequenced.

## Per Base Sequence Quality
- The horizontal axis denotes the read positions, while the vertical axis displays the quality scores. 
- High-quality single-cell data: all the yellow boxes which represent the inter-quantile range of position quality scores, should align with the green region. Likewise, the whiskers which represent the 10th and 90th percentiles of the distribution, should also fall within the green area.
