## Basic Statistics
- High-quality single-cell data typically exhibit minimal instances of low-quality sequences and frequently have consistent sequence lengths. 
- The GC content should closely align with the overall GC composition of the genome or transcriptome specific to the species being sequenced.

## Per Base Sequence Quality
