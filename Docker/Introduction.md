# Docker
## What is a Docker?
The Docker is a platform for building, running, and shipping applications. The Docker on your development machine can run and function the same way on other test and product machines. The main reasons for using a Docker are: the deployment files are consistent between two machines; the software versions are consistent between two machines; the configuration settings (e.g., ennironment variables) are consistent between two machines. This allows us to consistently run an application on different machines. In a Docker, we can easily package up our application with its dependencies in an isolated environment called `container`. This Docker can be run on any machine. 

## Benefit of container
Two applications with different dependencies are packed in isolated environments. They can be installed/deleted or run on the same machine without messing with each other.
