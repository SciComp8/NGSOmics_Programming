# Docker
## What is a Docker?
A platform for building, running, and shipping applications. The Docker on your development machine can run and function the same way on other test and product machines. The reasons are: the deployment files are consistent between two machines; the software version are consistent between two machines; the configuration settings (ennironment variables) are consistent between two machines.
