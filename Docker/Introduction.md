## What is a Docker?
The Docker is a platform for building, running, and shipping applications. The Docker on your development machine can run and function the same way on other test and product machines. The main reasons for using a Docker are: the deployment files are consistent between two machines; the software versions are consistent between two machines; the configuration settings (e.g., ennironment variables) are consistent between two machines. In a Docker, we can easily package up our application with its dependencies. We can run this Docker on any machine.
