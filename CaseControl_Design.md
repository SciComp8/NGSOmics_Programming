# Features of a case-control study
- An observational study
- A retrospective study that depends on recalling and recording events that happened before the selection of cases and controls
- Use odds ratio to measure the association between the exposure and disease

# Basic idea
- We hypothesize that the exposure to a factor increases an individual's risk of developing the disease
- We select the individuals with the disease as cases, and the individuals without the disease who are comparable to the cases as controls
- We compare the odds of exposure in cases and controls to derive the odds ratio
