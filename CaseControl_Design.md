# Features of a case-control study
- An observational study
- A retrospective study that depends on recalling and recording events that happened before the selection of cases and controls
- Use odds ratio to measure the association between the exposure and disease

# Basic idea
- We hypothesize that the exposure to a factor increases an individual's risk of developing the disease
- We select the individuals with the disease as cases, and the individuals without the disease who are comparable to the cases as controls
- We compare the odds of exposure in cases and controls to derive the odds ratio

# Selection of cases
- Define cases: 1) homogeneity of disease entity; 2) strict diagnostic criteria; 3) prevalent or incident cases
- Source of cases: hospitals; disease registries; medical practices; general population
- We typically take all the cases from the given source at the specified time

# Selection of controls
- The contols are from the **same source population** as the cases, such that they would have been identified and included as cases had they developed the disease
- Define controls: 1) free of the disease in question; 2) at risk of the disease; 3) other eligibility requirements as needed
- Source of controls: hospitals; medical practices; population rosters; workforce; coomunity organizations; **relatives of cases**; friends or neighbors of cases
- We typicall sample among potential controls

# Source of data - exposure
- Interviews with cases and controls
- Interviews with surrogates (relatives)
- Medical records
- Employment records
- Biologic specimens: **genetic characteristics**; cholesterol; infection; markers of environmental exposures
- Determine the accuracy of the exposure information since it is retrospective
