# Features of a case-control study
- An observational study
- A retrospective study that depends on recalling and recording events that happened before the selection of cases and controls
- Use odds ratio to measure the association between the exposure and disease

# Basic idea
- We hypothesize that the exposure to a factor increases an individual's risk of developing the disease
- We select the individuals with the disease as cases, and the individuals without the disease who are comparable to the cases as controls
- We compare the odds of exposure in cases and controls to derive the odds ratio

# Selection of cases
- Define cases: 1) homogeneity of disease entity; 2) strict diagnostic criteria; 3) prevalent or incident cases
- Source of cases: hospitals; disease registries; medical practices; general population
- We typically take all the cases from the given source at the specified time

# Selection of controls
- The contols are from the **same source population** as the cases, such that they would have been identified and included as cases had they developed the disease
- Define controls: 1) free of the disease in question; 2) at risk of the disease; 3) other eligibility requirements as needed
- Source of controls: hospitals; medical practices; population rosters; workforce; coomunity organizations; **relatives of cases**; friends or neighbors of cases
- We typicall sample among potential controls
- Who is the best control?
  - If cases are a random sample of all cases in the population, controls should be a random sample of all non-cases in the population sampled at the same time
  - If study cases are not a random sample of all cases, it is unlikely that a random sample of the population of non-cases will make up a good control population; in other words, controls must be selected so as to **mirror the same biases** that entered into the selection of cases
  - **Comparability** is more important than representativeness in the selection of controls; the control must be at risk of developing the disease; the control should **resemble the case in all respects except for the presence of disease**

# Source of data - exposure
- Interviews with cases and controls
- Interviews with surrogates (relatives)
- Medical records
- Employment records
- Biologic specimens: **genetic characteristics**; cholesterol; infection; markers of environmental exposures
- Determine the accuracy of the exposure information since it is retrospective

# Study base
- It is composed of a population at risk of exposure over a period of risk of exposure
- Both cases and controls should emerge from the same study base
- If cases are selected exclusively from hospitalized patients, controls must also be selected from hospitalized patients
- If cases must have gone through a certain ascertainment process (e.g., mammogram-detected screening), controls must have also
- If cases must have reached a certain age before they can become cases, so must controls
- If the exposure of interest is cumulative over time, the controls and cases must each have the same opportunity to be exposed to that exposure

# Issues in matching controls
