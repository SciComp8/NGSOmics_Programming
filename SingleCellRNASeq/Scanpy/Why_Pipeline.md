Pipelines simplify data preprocessing and modeling by combining multiple steps into one seamless process. 
Instead of managing each stage separately, you treat the entire pipeline as a single unit.

Pipeline offer several clear advantages:
- **Cleaner Code:** Pipelines eliminate the need to manually track data through each preprocessing phase.
- **Fewer Bugs:** By automating sequential steps, pipelines reduce the chance of missing or misapplying a process.
- **Easier Productionization:** Transitioning from prototype to scalable deployment is smoother with a pipeline.
- **Enhanced Validation:** Pipelines enable more robust validation techniques, such as cross-validation.
