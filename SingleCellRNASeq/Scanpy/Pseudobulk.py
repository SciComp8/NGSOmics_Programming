# Before conducting differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, it's essential to aggregate the expression values specific to each cell type within an individual. 
# This aggregation can be achieved by using either a sum, mean, or random effect for each individual. 
# This process, known as pseudobulk generation, is critical for addressing correlations that exist within a sample.
