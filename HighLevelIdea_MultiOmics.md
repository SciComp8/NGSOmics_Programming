# DNA + RNA
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been effective in identifying genetic variants linked to complex diseases. While these genotypes reveal disease susceptibility, pinpointing the specific genes and pathways influenced by these variants is challenging. Integrating RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) allows researchers to annotate and prioritize GWAS-identified variants for functional analysis, aiding in understanding disease mechanisms. Analyzing gene expression shows whether and when genes of interest are upregulated or downregulated in disease samples. This multiomic approach enhances drug target identification and biomarker discovery in functional genomics.

# DNA + protein
Connecting genetic variations to protein expression at the single-cell level allows us to uncover unique cell identities and subtle cellular states, thereby enhancing our ability to conduct more informed research in the realms of disease and therapeutic development. This approach is particularly valuable in cancer research, where deciphering the relationship between genotype and phenotype is crucial for understanding tumor evolution and the progression of diseases.

# RNA + protein
While established technologies like single-cell RNA sequencing can uncover new cell types and states within complex tissues, they often struggle to distinguish functionally distinct categories of immune cells that may be molecularly similar.

Authors in this [Cell paper](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00583-3) conduct an independent unsupervised analysis of RNA and protein data, highlighting both consistent cell classifications and some discrepancies. Specifically, the paper mentions that CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were somewhat mixed when analyzing RNA but clearly separated in the protein data. On the other hand, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), along with a rare population of erythroid progenitors and murine 3T3 controls, formed distinct clusters in RNA analysis but were mixed with other cell types based on protein abundance.
