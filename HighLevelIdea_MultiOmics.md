# DNA + RNA
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been effective in identifying genetic variants linked to complex diseases. While these genotypes reveal disease susceptibility, pinpointing the specific genes and pathways influenced by these variants is challenging. Integrating RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) allows researchers to annotate and prioritize GWAS-identified variants for functional analysis, aiding in understanding disease mechanisms. Analyzing gene expression shows whether and when genes of interest are upregulated or downregulated in disease samples. This multiomic approach enhances drug target identification and biomarker discovery in functional genomics.

Authors in this [Nature Medicine paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01212-6) were interested in how the SS18-SSX fusion influences the interaction between cancer cells and the immune system in synovial sarcoma (SyS). They tried to understand the tumor microenvironment's complexity by separately analyzing and integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data with genetic analysis. The scRNA-seq identified and characterized different cell populations within the tumor, including a malignant subpopulation that creates immune-deprived niches. The genetic analysis provided insights into the role of the SS18-SSX fusion in regulating this malignant cell state and its impact on clinical outcomes. This dual approach is crucial for dissecting the heterogeneity within SyS tumors and for understanding the mechanisms of immune evasion driven by oncogenic processes.

In the context of solid organ transplant, the longevity and impact of donor-derived immune cells on rejection are uncertain. Traditional methods for differentiating between donor and recipient immune cells were restricted to transplants with gender mismatches, utilizing Y chromosome identification. Employing a multiomic approach, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used to detect genetic differences between donor and recipient. This was coupled with sequencing the transcripts of individual immune cells from human kidney biopsies, allowing researchers to trace single nucleotide variants in expressed genes back to their cellular origin. The [study](https://journals.lww.com/jasn/fulltext/2020/09000/harnessing_expressed_single_nucleotide_variation.12.aspx) involved single-cell immune profiling to examine the transcriptomes of over 5000 macrophages and 3600 lymphocytes. The authors observed that macrophages and T-cells originating from recipients exhibited **unique proinflammatory gene expression patterns**. Notably, donor-derived cells were found to persist for years post-transplant. Insights gained from this research could pave the way for more precisely tailored immunosuppressive medications, enhancing organ transplant outcomes.

# DNA + epigenetics 
Most human genetic variations identified in GWAS are located in the genome's noncoding regions, such as introns, promoters, and enhancers. To understand the function of these variants, comprehensive epigenetic profiling is key to reveal gene regulation patterns. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based epigenetic methods, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-Seq), and chromosome conformation capture techniques like Capture C and HiC, are instrumental in this process. Additionally, conserved DNA methylation patterns may serve as a novel category of biomarkers. Integrating methylation or other epigenetic data with genetic information through multiomic approaches allows for the exploration of complex pathways and disease mechanisms by linking various functional layers.

# DNA + protein
Connecting genetic variations to protein expression at the single-cell level allows us to uncover unique cell identities and subtle cellular states, thereby enhancing our ability to conduct more informed research in the realms of disease and therapeutic development. This approach is particularly valuable in cancer research, where deciphering the relationship between genotype and phenotype is crucial for understanding tumor evolution and the progression of diseases.

# RNA + protein
While established technologies like single-cell RNA sequencing can uncover new cell types and states within complex tissues, they often struggle to distinguish functionally distinct categories of immune cells that may be molecularly similar.

Authors in this [Cell paper](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00583-3) conduct an independent unsupervised analysis of RNA and protein data, highlighting both consistent cell classifications and some discrepancies. Specifically, the paper mentions that CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were somewhat mixed when analyzing RNA but clearly separated in the protein data. On the other hand, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), along with a rare population of erythroid progenitors and murine 3T3 controls, formed distinct clusters in RNA analysis but were mixed with other cell types based on protein abundance.
