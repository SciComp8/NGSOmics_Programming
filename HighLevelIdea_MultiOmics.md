# DNA + protein
Connecting genetic variations to protein expression at the single-cell level allows us to uncover unique cell identities and subtle cellular states, thereby enhancing our ability to conduct more informed research in the realms of disease and therapeutic development. This approach is particularly valuable in cancer research, where deciphering the relationship between genotype and phenotype is crucial for understanding tumor evolution and the progression of diseases.
