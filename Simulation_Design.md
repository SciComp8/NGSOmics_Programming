## How to prove that a method based on the A probabilistic distribution shows performance comparable to or better compared to another method based on the B probabilistic distribution?
- A/B: Normal/Binomial/Poisson/Gamma/Negative binomial/Log-normal/Hypergeometric/Laplace/Pareto/Dirichlet/Leptokurtic...
- Design simulations where the variable of interest are generated using the B probabilistic distribution as another analytical model assumes. 
- These simulations will be the benchmark for the method based on the B probabilistic distribution. 
- If an approach based on the A probabilistic distribution can demonstrate performance equal to or surpassing a method based on the B probabilistic distribution in these simulations, it strongly suggests its competitiveness across the data generated from the B probabilistic distribution.
