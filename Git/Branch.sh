# Why use braches?
# Systematically track multiple versions of files
# Minimize the risk of conflicting versions
# Avoid endless subdirectories
# Allow multiple users to work simultaneously

# Display branches
git branch
# *: current branch

# Create a new branch from the current branch
git checkout -b new_branch_name
git branch # Display branches again

# Compare the difference between branches
git diff branch_1 branch_2
