# Quantitative biology

This repository contains my coding practice using the materials from both the fundamental and cutting-edge computational biology/bioinformatics coursework, workshops, technical manuals, books, and other resources. My learning notes about recently developed computational biology/bioinformatics concepts from academic articles, blog posts, and podcasts are presented here, as well.

## Coding practice
<br>

**Analyze bulk RNA-Seq data**

  - [Align and count the reads](BulkRNASeq/AlignmentCountingTCell.Rmd)
  - [Differentially gene expression analysis](DEAnalysisTCell.Rmd)

**Analyze single cell RNA-Seq data**

**Build auto-encoder for somatic mutations**
