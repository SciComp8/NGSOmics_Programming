# Learn Bioinformatics

This repository contains my coding practice using the materials from fundamental and cutting-edge bioinformatics workshop, technical manuals, books, and other resources. It also contains my learning notes about recently developed bioinformatics concepts from academic articles, blog posts, and podcasts.

## Coding practice
**Build auto-encoder for somatic mutations**

**Analyze bulk RNA-Seq data**

**Analyze single cell RNA-Seq data**
