# Learn Bioinformatics

This repository shows my coding practice based on cutting-edge bioinformatics workshop, technical manuals, books, and other resources outside my school classes. It also presents my learning notes on popular bioinformatics concepts mainly from academic articles, blog posts, and podcasts.

## Coding practice
**Build auto-encoder for somatic mutations**

**Analyze single cell RNA-Seq data**


## Learning note
**Multimodal data integration**
