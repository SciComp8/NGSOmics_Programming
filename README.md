# Quantitative biology

This repository contains my coding practice and learning notes using the materials from computational biology/bioinformatics coursework, workshops, technical manuals, books, and other resources. 

## Coding practice
**Analyze bulk RNA-Seq data**

  - [Align and count the reads](BulkRNASeq/AlignmentCountingTCell.Rmd)
  - [Differential gene expression analysis](DEAnalysisTCell.Rmd)

<hr>

**Analyze single cell RNA-Seq data**

<hr>

**Build auto-encoder for somatic mutations**


## Learning note
